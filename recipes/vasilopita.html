    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>Vasilopita is a Greek cake with a citrus flavor that's not too sweet. It's traditionally served for breakfast or brunch on New Year's Day. Each person gets a slice starting with the youngest — whoever gets the coin hidden in their piece will have good luck for the year!</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>

            <li>1 cup butter</li>

            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>6 large eggs</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>

            <li>1 cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>

            <li>¼ cup blanched slivered almonds</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <div>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 10-inch round cake pan.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <div>Beat sugar and butter together in a medium bowl until lighter in color; stir in flour and mix <br> until the mixture is mealy. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Combine <br> baking powder and milk; add to egg mixture, mix well. Combine lemon juice and baking <br> soda; stir into the batter. Pour into the prepared cake pan.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <div>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove and sprinkle the nuts and sugar over the cake, <br> then return it to the oven until cake springs back to the touch, about 20 to 30 additional <br> minutes. Gently cut a small hole in the cake and place a quarter in the hole. Try to cover the <br> hole with sugar. Cool cake on a rack for 10 minutes before inverting onto a plate.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <div>Serve cake warm.</div>
        </li>
