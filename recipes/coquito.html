    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>This coquito recipe makes a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut flavor. It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, spices, rum, and, in this version, egg yolks. It is always requested at my holiday gatherings. Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself. Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon, if desired. Feliz Navidad!</p>
